# ðŸ¤– Multi-Robot Patrol & Obstacle Avoidance System (M-RPOS)

A modular ROS2-based simulation system for coordinating multiple robot agents to patrol an area and avoid obstacles. Supports Gazebo (gz sim) and keyboard control input.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Differential drive robots with obstacle sensors
- Multi-robot coordination with patrol zones
- Gazebo simulation + ROS2 nodes
- Keyboard teleoperation and velocity command bridges
- Docker support for reproducible environments

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- ROS2 (Humble or Jazzy)
- Gazebo Sim (Ignition/GZ)
- Python (for control nodes)
- URDF/Xacro for robot models
- Docker (optional)
